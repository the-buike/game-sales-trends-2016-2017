### game-sales-trends-2016-2017
This project looks at global video game sales to understand what makes some titles take off while others fade out. The dataset includes user and critic reviews, genres, platforms, and regional sales, giving a full picture of how different factors shape a game’s performance.

The goal is to uncover the patterns behind successful games and use those insights to plan marketing efforts for 2017, as if we were working in December 2016. By studying trends from 2016, the project highlights which genres, platforms, and regions offer the strongest opportunities for growth.

The work covers data cleaning, exploration, and statistical analysis to help an online store allocate its promotion budget wisely and focus on the types of games most likely to attract attention.
