User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g. Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. You need to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow you to spot potential big winners and plan advertising campaigns."

These insights will help Ice prioritize which upcoming titles to promote, allocate advertising budgets more effectively, and focus on the segments most likely to drive strong sales in 2017."
